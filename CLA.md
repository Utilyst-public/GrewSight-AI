This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") is between the undersigned contributor ("Contributor")
and **Utilyst Inc.** ("Company"). By contributing code, documentation, or other materials ("Contribution"),
Contributor agrees as follows:

1. **License Grant (Copyright & Related Rights).** Contributor grants Company a
   **perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, irrevocable, royalty‑free, fully paid‑up license**
   to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
   sublicense, and distribute the Contribution and derivative works thereof, in source or
   object form, for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

2. **Patent License.** Contributor grants Company a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive,
   irrevocable, royalty‑free patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
   import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution and derivative works thereof. This patent
   license applies to patent claims licensable by Contributor that are necessarily infringed
   by the Contribution. If Contributor or its affiliates initiates patent litigation
   (including a cross‑claim or counterclaim) alleging that the Work or a Contribution
   infringes a patent, then the patent licenses granted to Company under this Agreement
   shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

   to assert any moral rights or similar rights in the Contribution against Company or its
   sublicensees in connection with their use of the Contribution.

4. **Ownership & Third‑Party Rights.** Contributor represents and warrants that the Contribution
   is an original work created by Contributor (or Contributor has sufficient rights to submit it)
   and that it does not violate any third‑party rights. If the Contribution includes third‑party
   materials, Contributor will disclose them and their licenses.

5. **No Obligation.** Company is under no obligation to use, merge, publish, or release any
   Contribution. Contributions may be used, modified, or discarded at Company's discretion.

6. **No Support or Compensation.** Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Contributions are made
   without expectation of payment, support, or attribution beyond what Company chooses to provide.

7. **Governing Law & Venue.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York,
   without regard to conflict of laws principles. Exclusive venue lies in state or federal courts
   located in New York, New York.
